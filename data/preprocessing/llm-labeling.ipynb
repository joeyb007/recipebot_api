    "Now that our XGBoost models have been created, we can use these models to robustly label more examples and fine-tune an LLM for recipe generation. This will esentially act as a three-step pipeline.\n",
    "1. Recipe data will be preprocessed into a suitable output format and labeled with XGB \n",
    "2. The LLM will be locally fine-tuned with this data\n",
    "3. LLM outputs will be judged by XGBoost models, effectively acting as an offline RL-style learning system.\n",
    "The present document addresses the first part of this problem."
